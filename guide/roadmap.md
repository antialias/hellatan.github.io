# Roadmap (aka add this functionality) in no specific order

- Post pagination (metalsmith-collections-paginate plugin?)
- Create a page that groups articles under their respective author
- Add more functionality to the YFM and displaying appropriately (ie author social media links)
- Figure out the issue when using metalsmith-jquery (no ticket filed on github yet)
- Add a "tags" page (would require updating posts with tags info)
